This dataset, available on Maven Analytics, contains B2B sales opportunities from a CRM database for a fictitious company, MavenTech, which sells computer hardware to large businesses. The dataset includes information on:

- Customer accounts  
- Products sold

The dataset covers the period from October 2016 to December 2017 and supports detailed analysis of revenue performance, pipeline health, individual productivity, product effectiveness, sector profitability, and team-level comparisons.

## Business Scenario

MavenTech is a U.S.-based company specialising in enterprise hardware solutions. The company recently implemented a new CRM platform to manage sales opportunities, but leadership faced a critical challenge:

Sales data existed in the CRM system, but managers lacked clear visibility into performance trends, team effectiveness, and revenue drivers.

To address this, an interactive Power BI dashboard solution was developed to:

- Empower sales managers with real-time performance insights  
- Support coaching, forecasting, and strategic planning  
- Enable data-driven leadership decisions  

## Assumptions

- Sales managers require both individual and team-level performance monitoring.  
- Teams are allowed to compare performance across the business.  
- Quarterly performance tracking is essential for:
  - Target evaluation  
  - End-of-quarter sales pushes  
- Dashboards must be easy to interpret, supported with tooltips and intuitive visuals.
