The dataset covers the period from October 2016 to December 2017 and supports detailed analysis of revenue performance, pipeline health, individual productivity, product effectiveness, sector profitability, and team-level comparisons.

## Business Scenario

MavenTech is a U.S.-based company specialising in enterprise hardware solutions. The company recently implemented a new CRM platform to manage sales opportunities, but leadership faced a critical challenge:

Although large volumes of sales data were being collected, managers had limited visibility into:
- Quarterly performance trends  
- Individual sales effectiveness  
- Product contribution  
- Team-level performance comparisons  

As a Business Intelligence Developer, I designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard system** that enables managers to analyse sales performance at three levels:

- Individual sales representatives  
- Products, industries, and customers  
- Sales teams (strategic comparison)

This solution transforms raw CRM data into actionable management insights.

## Assumptions

- Sales managers require both individual and team-level performance monitoring.  
- Teams are allowed to compare performance across the business.  
- Quarterly performance tracking is essential for:
  - Target evaluation  
  - End-of-quarter sales pushes  
- Dashboards must be easy to interpret, supported with tooltips and intuitive visuals.
